        <h1>How I Started</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>About Meâ€¦.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>From a young age, I had a fascination with electronics and a natural inclination to tinker with them. This led me
            to upgrade the RAM on my first laptop at the age of 13, an endeavour that I initially believed had resulted in
            the device being irreparably damaged. However, to my delight, it actually worked, igniting a passion in me for
            electronics and setting me on a path toward a career in this field.
    
            When I was 15, I experienced the common frustration of an iPhone screen breaking, and after receiving exorbitant
            quotes from repair shops, I turned to self-reliance. Following a YouTube tutorial, I successfully repaired my
            phone with a new screen that I had ordered online for just $30. I realized that I could offer this same
            affordable service to others, and thus began my foray into electronics repair.
    
            Believing that more affordable repair options were necessary, I began learning the trade and honing my skills as
            a high school student. When I had repaired about 50 devices, I had gained enough confidence to start my own
            brand. I focused on building a positive reputation through social media and word-of-mouth referrals, utilizing
            reviews from satisfied customers to showcase my abilities and gain the trust of potential clients.</p>
